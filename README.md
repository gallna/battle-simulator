My implementation of Battle simulator game

Repository contains only core of a game with basic validation.

## Missing:
- User interaction functionality (input/output)
- Configuration for different combatant types
- Random combatant and property determination

`example.php` illustrate how I would imagine some missing game parts
- use SplPriorityQueue to determinate who attack first
- use Battler skill property to determinate what happen in current turn
